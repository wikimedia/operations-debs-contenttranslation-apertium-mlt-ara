Many thanks to:
- Prof. Janusz Danecki, for advice and providing a Maltese
dictionary and a grammar book,
- Georges Kass, PhD, for postediting the evaluation texts
(to be found in the dev/story/ subdirectory),
- John J. Camillieri, for translating the first evaluation
text (dev/story/story.mt.txt) to Maltese.

The Maltese analyser (apertium-mt-ar.mt.dix) is an extended
version the Maltese analyser from apertium-mt-he.
